# 🐧 Introduction to Linux: Basics of Working in the Command Line

In the first part, we will take a closer look (and repeat) at working with the command line in the Linux OS.

Linux is an open source operating system similar to Unix. Unix was developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs. At the time, it was considered the first multi-user, multi-tasking operating system. It was developed at the University of Berkeley and became known as the "Berkley Software Distribution" or BSD. Today, MacOS is also very similar to it, which comes from the BSD family, specifically FreeBSD.

Linux refers to the name of the operating system kernel. There are many distributions available that are based on the Linux kernel: Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Kali Linux, Arch Linux, ...

## 🎯 Objective
To learn the basics of working with the command line in a Linux environment.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to:
✅ execute basic commands in Linux
✅ browse directories, create directories and files
✅ connect to a Linux server via ssh

---

## ⚙️ Prepare the environment

For this tutorial, we will use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

GitHub Codespaces is a development environment hosted in the cloud. It is intended for project development, where we connect to the GitHub repository, which allows us to develop within a web browser, and we can also access a virtual environment.

It is recommended that you prepare your own virtual environment for the needs of the tutorials by next time, either:
- within a virtual environment (VMWare, VirtualBox, etc.)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Microsoft Azure or another cloud service
- an existing environment if you use Linux OS/Max OS X/BSD, etc.

It is recommended that you install the Kali Linux distribution, which already includes all the tools we will use in the exercises.

## 🧪 Creating a Github Codespace environment:

1. On the link [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) select the option "Get started for free"

2. On the left side or via quick access, select the option "Blank"

3. Github Codespaces will create a web environment for us through which we can access the command line.

By default, Github Codespaces does not allow access via SSH, so we will use a trick and arrange access via SSH. For a production solution, I do not recommend this approach, use gh cli instead. The above part serves only as a demonstration.

First, create a user with whom we will work, so that we do not use the default user.

```bash
whoami # check the current user
sudo adduser user # user is your desired username, the wizard will ask us for the password and user data, which we confirm. Attention: the password is not visible when we log in.
sudo usermod -aG sudo user
sudo visudo
```

Add the following entry under # User privilege specification
```bash
user ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

Now we start the SSH service
```bash
sudo service ssh start # start the ssh service
sudo apt update # update the package list
sudo apt install tmate # install the tmate package
tmate # start tmate
```

The information for connecting to ssh via a special session is displayed. With Ctrl + C we interrupt the display and gain access to using the command line.

## 🧪 Connecting to the server

We can log in to the server from the offending shell.
```bash
su - user # switch to the user we created and enter the password
```

## 🧪 Exercise: Basic commands

### 1️⃣ Navigating the system
```bash
pwd # display the current path
ls # display the contents of a directory
ls -l # display the contents with details
cd /path/to/directory # change directory
cd .. # move to the parent directory
```

✅ **Task:**
- Move to your home directory.
```bash
cd ~
```

- Create the `linux-exercise` directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir linux-exercise
  ```
  
- Enter it.
```bash
cd linux-exercise
```
---

### 2️⃣ Working with files and directories
```bash
mkdir newFolder # create a new directory
touch file.txt # create an empty file
nano file.txt # edit the contents (or `vim` / `code`)
cat file.txt # list the contents
rm file.txt # delete the file
rm -r newFolder # delete the directory with the contents
```

✅ **Task:**
- Create the file `description.txt` and write your name in it.
```bash
touch description.txt
nano description.txt
SaNjA
```
  
- Create the directory `test`.
```bash
 mkdir test
```
mkdir newFolder # create a new directory
touch file.txt # create an empty file
nano file.txt # edit the contents (or `vim` / `code`)
cat file.txt # list the contents
rm file.txt # delete the file
rm -r newFolder # delete the directory with the contents
```
  
- Move `description.txt` to `test`.
mv description.txt test/

---

### 3️⃣ Moving and copying
```bash
mv dat.txt other.txt # rename the file
cp file1.txt file2.txt # copy the file
mv file.txt /path/to/otherfolder/ # move
```
✅ **Task:**
- Rename `description.txt` to `my_profile.txt`.
```bash
cd test
mv description.txt my_profile.txt
```
- Copy `my_profile.txt` to your home folder.
```bash
cp my_profile.txt ~/
```

---

### 4️⃣ Permissions and Sizes
```bash
ls -lh # size and permissions
du -sh ./* # file/directory size
chmod 644 file # change permissions
```

✅ **Task:**
- Check the size of all files in the folder.
```bash
du -sh ./*
4.0K    ./my_profile.txt

```
- Change the permissions of the file `my_profile.txt` to be read-only for everyone.
```bash
ls -lh
chmod 444 my_profile.txt
ls -l my_profile.txt
-r--r--r-- 1 SaNjA SaNjA 6 May 26 10:09 my_profile.txt
```
---

### 5️⃣ View System Information
```bash
whoami # your username
uname -a # system information
df -h # disk usage
top # active processes
```

✅ **Task:**
- Find out your username and the size of your home directory.

```bash
whoami
SaNjA

du -sh ~
152K    /home/SaNjA

```
- Check how much space is available on your system.
```bash
df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            883M     0  883M   0% /dev
tmpfs           198M  984K  197M   1% /run
/dev/sda1        79G   19G   57G  25% /
tmpfs           986M  4.0K  986M   1% /dev/shm
none            1.0M     0  1.0M   0% /run/credentials/systemd-journald.service
tmpfs           986M  100K  986M   1% /tmp
AppliedCrypto   238G  234G  4.7G  99% /media/sf_AppliedCrypto
none            1.0M     0  1.0M   0% /run/credentials/getty@tty1.service
tmpfs           198M  104K  198M   1% /run/user/1000
```
---

## 💡 Extra task
Find the largest file in your home directory:
```bash
du -ah ~ | sort -rh | head -n 5
┌──(SaNjA㉿kali)-[~/linux-exercise/test]
└─$ du -ah ~ | sort -rh | head -n 5
152K /home/SaNjA
40K /home/SaNjA/.config
28K /home/SaNjA/.local
20K /home/SaNjA/.local/share
16K /home/SaNjA/.java
```
